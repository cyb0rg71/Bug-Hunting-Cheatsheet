## **1. Detecting Cached Responses**

To confirm caching behavior, inspect response headers and time differences:

- **`X-Cache: hit`** – Response served from the cache.  
- **`X-Cache: miss`** – Response fetched from the origin server and potentially cached.  
- **`X-Cache: refresh`** – Cache was outdated and revalidated.

Additionally, check `Cache-Control` headers for caching directives like `public` with a non-zero `max-age`.

## **2. Cache Rules**

Attackers exploit web server cache rules in several ways. Below are common techniques:

---

### **1. Exploiting Static File Extension Rules**

#### **Description**  
Caching mechanisms often rely on file extensions such as `.css`, `.js`, or `.jpg` to categorize content as static. Attackers can use discrepancies to cache sensitive dynamic data.

---

#### **Path Mapping Discrepancies**

1. Add `/wcd` (an arbitrary path) after the original path.  
2. If the response is the same, append a static file extension like `.js` or `.css`.  
3. Use the crafted URL for exploitation.  

---

#### **Path Delimiter Discrepancies**

1. Add a delimiter (`;`) after the original path.  
2. If the response is the same, append `/wcd` with a file extension like `.js` or `.css`.  
3. Use the crafted URL for exploitation.

---

#### **Path Delimiter Decoding Discrepancies**

1. Similar to delimiter discrepancies but use encoded delimiters like `%3b` (URL-encoded `;`).  
2. Test the response and confirm caching behavior.  
3. Craft and exploit the malicious URL.

### **2. Exploiting Static Directory Rules**

#### **Description**  
Many web servers store static resources in predefined directories (e.g., `/static/`, `/assets/`, `/scripts/`). Cache rules often target these directories, making them susceptible to Web Cache Deception.

---

#### **Normalization Discrepancies by the Origin Server**

1. Add `/<static-directory-prefix>/..%2f<dynamic-path>` to the URL.  
   - **Example**: `/assets/..%2fprofile`.  

The origin server resolves the path traversal, serving dynamic content, while the cache stores it as static.

---

#### **Normalization Discrepancies by the Cache Server**

1. Use the reverse pattern: `/<dynamic-path>%2f%2e%2e%2f<static-directory-prefix>`.  
   - **Example**: `/profile%2f%2e%2e%2fassets`.  

The cache interprets it differently, potentially exposing sensitive data.

---

### **3. Exploiting File Name Cache Rules**

#### **Description**  
Certain files (e.g., `robots.txt`, `index.html`, `favicon.ico`) are often cached due to their infrequent changes. Attackers can exploit these caching mechanisms by targeting specific file names.

---

#### **Steps**  

1. Follow the same patterns used for normalization discrepancies but target filenames like:
   - `robots.txt`
   - `index.html`
   - `favicon.ico`.

Example crafted URL: `/robots.txt%2f%2e%2e%2fprofile`.  

The cache might store sensitive data while treating it as a standard file.
